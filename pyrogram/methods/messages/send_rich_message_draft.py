        chat_id: int | str,

        """Use this method to stream a partial rich message to a user while the message is being generated.

        .. note::

            The streamed draft is ephemeral and acts as a temporary 30-second preview - once the output is finalized,
            you must call :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.send_rich_message` with the complete message to persist it in the user's chat.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            draft_id (``int``):
                Unique identifier of the message draft, must be non-zero.
                Changes of drafts with the same identifier are animated.

            rich_message (:obj:`pyrogram.types.InputRichMessage`):
                The partial message to be streamed.

            message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier for the target message thread.

            can_stop (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass *True* to show the user a button to stop further drafts.

            keep_on_stop (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass *True* to keep the draft in the chat when the button is pressed.
                The draft will still disappear after a short time or if the bot sends a message.
                To fully preserve the partial draft, the bot should send it as a new message.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                words = text.split()
